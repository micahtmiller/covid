# Objective

This project is a fun little Data Science project using COVID data.  In order to demonstrate and end-to-end project, I will produce the following:
* Branching Strategy
* Testing
* Deployment (CI/CD)
* Infrastructure (Terraform)
* Visualization

## Branching Strategy

I have become accustomed to using [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching strategy. So I will demonstrate the use of this strategy within my GitHub project.  Please look at my branching history to validate.

## Testing

All good software has tests, and using Test-Driven-Development practices ensures that tests are created early and often.  Honestly, this is not a strength of mine, as it requires discipline.  It is critical to production code, so I will stay focused.

## Deployment

In order to better manage our development cycle, it is important to set up automated deployment pipelines, which I will do using Cloud Build in GCP.

## Infrastructure

If I don't have DEV/QA/PROD environments set up, I cannot run any code, so I will configure all infrastructure using Terraform.  This way, there is no manual intervention, which means more reliable, re-deployable infrastructure.

## Visualization

At the end of the day, someone needs to be able to see something.  I haven't identified what technology I will use for visualization, but DataStudio will probably be a good start.
